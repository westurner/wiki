Patches
---------
Also referred to as a diff.

When an author has modified a file in a repository,
there is a difference (in terms of text lines and/or bytes changed)
between their local revision and
the repository revision they started with.
That's called a 'diff' or a 'patch'.

To share those changes, an author must submit a patch to
a repository maintainer, who is responsible for applying
or not applying the changes to a branch of a repository.

The patch review feedback cycle -- classically over NNTP or SMTP (email) --
can produce lots of text: both revisions to the patch and an
asynchronous stream of emails and IRC messages.

Patch attributes

Issues
--------

An issue records attributes of, notes regarding, and progress towards a finite request, report, or work item.

Issues are often also referred to as tickets, issues, cards, and bugtracking.

Agile methodologies for working with issues:

Pull Requests
--------------
Projects hosted with GitHub and BitBucket generally support accepting,
reviewing, and merging changes as pull requests; which, like
regular patches people used to send over the email,
are hunks of differences between one or more files.

Unlike a patch archived in a mailing list,
pull requests have
a free-form comment stream
and line-based commenting
-- features which simplify the change review and evaluation feedback loop.


Send a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Branch/fork, update, commit
* Compare, test (review diff)
* DOC: Prepend `Code Labels`_ to first line of patch header (commit message)
* Send a pull request

   * Email: Send a URL to the branch to pull from (tags: ``.tasks``, ``.code``, ``-waiting``)
   * GitHub: Click 'Send Pull Request'
   * BitBucket: Click 'Send Pull Request'

* Open Loop: ``-waiting`` for feedback


Review a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Open Loop: they're waiting for feedback
* Read, ReviewTest*, Respond
* Check whether the tests pass with the pull request applied
* Apply or do not apply

   * Do Not Apply

     * Send feedback: not interested, needs work

   * Apply

     * Update release log (See: `<#code-labels>`__)
     * Commit
     * Push



Lists
======

Mental
-------
* Mnemonics
* String around one's finger
* Note on one's hand
* Cognitive representation (mental picture) of a list
* Graph with edges that have magnitude

  + [ ] When: Date recorded
  + [ ] Where: Location recorded
  + [ ] When: Date of task/event milestone
  + [ ] Where: Location for task/event milestone
  + [ ] What,Why,How: Description

Paper
------

Pros
~~~~~

.. epigraph::

    Just pick up a sheet of paper,
    write something down,
    and hand it to me.

* Classic, ubiquitous
* Visual
* Battery-free

Cons
~~~~~
.. epigraph::

    Ask ____ to ask _____ to have that sent over to _________.

Collaboration strategy:

* Backup: manual replication: scanner, copier, keyboard
* Sharing: who has which version of this sheet of paper?
* Synchrony: Correlating list status
* When: things were added/update/*renamed*/completed
* When,Why: Assigning and sorting by priority

and WikiText linking extensions.

* `GitHub Wiki`_ (Markdown, ReStructuredText)
* BitBucket Wiki (Markdown)
* Trac Wiki (Trac Wiki, ReStructuredText)
* wiki.python.org (MoinMoin)
* Wikipedia (Mediawiki)

Wikis are good for:

  * Links Pages, Outlines
  * Roadmaps, Todo lists

* Pandoc converts (sometimes lossily) between many wiki markup syntaxes


GitHub Wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These ``.rst`` ReStructuredText files are maintained with a ``.rest``
extension to make it possible to edit these pages as both
a GitHub wiki and
a normal Sphinx git repository
manually published to a ``gh-pages`` branch.

Best Practices
============================
Use Project Templates
-----------------------
- [ ] Generate a new project with templated packaging and documentation

  - https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter

    - https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#available-cookiecutters
    - https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#cookiecutter-meta

.. _requirements-traceability:

Develop Projects with Requirements Traceability
------------------------------------------------

GitHub / Gitlab Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- [ ] When you create a new GitHub / GitLab project,

  - [ ] Create Issue #1. You could call it ``#1`` and leave it blank for now.

  - [ ] Write a Roadmap wiki entry with links to Release Plans
    and/or issue milestones
    (`<https://github.com/westurner/wiki.wiki.git>`_ / ``Roadmap.rest``)

    * Roadmap wiki page: https://github.com/westurner/wiki/wiki/Roadmap

  - [ ] Create a milestone and an issue for it

    * [ ] Milestone:

      - https://github.com/westurner/wiki/milestones/0.1 (open)
      - https://github.com/westurner/wiki/issues?q=milestone%3A0.1
        (open/closed)

    * [ ] Milestone Issue:

      - https://github.com/westurner/wiki/issues/17 "Milestone 1"

        - [ ] Link to the milestone issues URLs
        - [ ] Add the Deadline:/Ends: and/or Completed: date
        - [ ] Add a link to the release tag

    * [ ] Add a link from Issue #1 to the Milestone Issue

Use Code Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [ ] Prefix commit messages with `Code Labels`_::

      TST: Create order placing tests
      DOC: Add order placing documentation
      BLD: Update the build configuration

  - [ ] Write Features and *User Stories* as issues prefixed with ``STORY``
    and ``ENH:``::

        STORY: Users can place orders
        ENH: app/orders: Show the cart item count in the header


Use Links
~~~~~~~~~~~
Create traceable edges between things by adding links.

- [ ] Link between **Issues**, **Commits**, **Pull Requests**, and
  other docs by referencing an issue number in a title, description,
  or comment::

      TST: Create order placing tests (#123)
      TST: Create order placing tests (projname#123)
      TST: Create order placing tests (orgname/projname#123)
      DOC: Add order placing documentation (for #123)
      CLN: Cleanup syntax for style guide (#5678)

- [ ] Link between **Issues**, **Commits**, **Pull Requests**, and
  *Release Logs* by referencing a full URL with no anchor text
  and optional trailing title or description::

      https://github.com/westurner/wiki/issues/1


Revision Control
-----------------

GitFlow and HubFlow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:ref:`GitFlow` and :ref:`HubFlow` are workflow and branch management
systems for :ref:`Git` and `GitHub`
which specify and implement branch naming conventions
and merge patterns which can minimize
the need to teach new collaborators how we prefer to do branches
around here.

Sometimes GitFlow and HubFlow do fail though, so it's good to understand
which git commands they're running for you so that:

- ``master`` only has stable releases that are cleanly merged in from a
  named release branch (``release/0.1.0``) which is a branch of
  ``develop``
- ``hotfix`` branches (``hotfix/CVE-2001-fix-urgent-bug``)
  are merged to ``master`` as new releases and also into ``develop``
- feature branches (``feature/3-STORY-users-can-place-orders``)
  branch from ``develop``;
  and are always expected to ``git rebase -i develop``
  before a Pull Request can be considered for merging


Continuous Integration

* [ ] Run tests before releasing
* [ ] Run tests before merging (e.g. Pull Request Webhooks)
* [ ] Run tests after merging. (e.g. HubFlow
  [``feature/*`` ->] ``develop`` ->
  ``release/v0.1.0`` -> ``master`` branch structure)
* [ ] Run tests before committing (while coding)
* [ ] Run tests when committing
  (with [required/local/central] repo event scripts such as pre-commit
  hooks)

  * https://pre-commit.github.io

* [ ] Write Tests First.
* [ ] Utilize Git HubFlow for managing project repository branches:
  ``develop``, ``master``, ``feature/*``, ``release/*``, ``hotfix/*``

  * https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/
  * https://westurner.github.io/tools/#git
  * https://westurner.github.io/tools/#hubflow

* [ ] Release semantic versions (`<http://semver.org>`_) tagged as
  ``major.minor.patch`` (e.g. ``v1.0.01``)

  * Semver 3.0 (Python PEP 440 versiontag-compatible):
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pbr/semver.html

    * PEP 440:
      "Version Identification and Dependency Specification"
      https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#examples-of-compliant-version-schemes

  * bumpversion https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion

- [ ] Include useful data (like version, revision, platform)
  in package filenames (and/or also create a JSON-LD metadata manifest):

  * e.g. ``westurner-wiki-v1.0.01-eb4df7f-linux64.whl``

  * Conda selectors: {``linux64``, ``py27``, ``py37`` }
    `<http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#preprocessing-selectors>`_
  * pbr (*Python Build Reasonableness*)
